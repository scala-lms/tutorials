/**

Shonan Challenge
================

In this tutorial we will develop a solution to the HMM problem from the Shonan Challenge.

The task is to implement a sparse matrix vector product, where the matrix is statically
known but the vector is not. This situation comes up in hidden markov models (HMM),
where a single transition matrix is multiplied by many different observation vectors.
Therefore, it pays off to generate code that is specialized to a particular matrix.

LMS works, play with static vs dynamic expressions.

an `if/else` statement will be generated.

/**
Notice the `if/else` statement in the generated code.

.. includecode:: ../../../../out/shonan-hmm1b_dyn.check.scala

Aside: LMS relies on Scala's local type inference to propagate dynamic
expressions (`Rep` types) automatically within a method, and on
Scala's type checker to ensure the binding times (dynamic vs static)
are consistent.

Aside: In the snippet, the `if/else` statement with the dynamic
condition is peculiar, because its condition is not a plain `Boolean`
but a `Rep[Boolean]`. Hence, LMS also relies on virtualization of
control structures to overload the meaning of control structures such
as `if/else` and `while` -- in the same way that the `for` syntax is
overloaded in Scala.

/**
STEP 1: Staging the matrix vector product
-----------------------------------------

We want to change the `matrix_vector_prod` function to take a dynamic
vector and a static matrix. We move it into the `DslDriver` trait so
that it can use `Rep`.

We generate nested loops by default (type `Rep[Range]`). This means that
the loop index becomes a `Rep[Int]` value. To access the static matrix,
we need to lift it to a `Rep` value as well. We accomplish this with
the help of `staticData`.

We also need to replace `new Array` with `NewArray`: instead of creating
an array at staging time, we want to generate code to create a the array.

Now we can play with the loop shapes: `Range` loops are computed
statically, i.e. unrolled at staging time. `Rep[Range]` loops cause
generation of loop code.

We can make unrolling decisions in a very fine-grained manner:
for dense rows we want to generate a loop, for sparse rows
we want to unroll. We just add a condition `sparse` and dispatch
to either a `Range` or a `Rep[Range]` loop.

  test("shonan-hmm1c") {
    val snippet = new DslDriver[Array[Int],Array[Int]] {
      def snippet(v: Rep[Array[Int]]) = {

        def matrix_vector_prod(a0: Array[Array[Int]], v: Rep[Array[Int]]) = {
          val n = a0.length
          val a = staticData(a0)
          val v1 = NewArray[Int](n)

          for (i <- (0 until n):Range) {
            val sparse = a0(i).count(_ != 0) < 3
            if (sparse) {
              for (j <- (0 until n):Range) {
                v1(i) = v1(i) + a(i).apply(j) * v(j)
              }
            } else {
              for (j <- (0 until n):Rep[Range]) {
                v1(i) = v1(i) + a(i).apply(j) * v(j)
              }
            }
          }
          v1

        v1
      }

    check("shonan-hmm1c", snippet.code)
  }

/**
Looking at the generated code, we can easily see that we get a while
loop for row 0, which is dense, no operations for row 1, and an
unrolled loop for row 2, which is sparse:

      .. includecode:: ../../../../out/shonan-hmm1c.check.scala


STEP 2: Conditional unrolling
-----------------------------

The code duplication of the loop body above is not very nice. Fortunately,
we can create arbitrary staging-time abstractions. Here, we create an auxiliary
method `unrollIf` that captures the conditional unrolling pattern in a general
way. The `matrix_vector_prod` function no longer needs to express the loop
body twice.

The generated code is identical: _"abstraction without regret"_ FTW!

          def foreach(f: Rep[Int] => Rep[Unit]) = {
            if (c) for (j <- (r.start until r.end):Range)      f(j)
            else   for (j <- (r.start until r.end):Rep[Range]) f(j)

          for (i <- (0 until n):Range) {
            val sparse = a0(i).count(_ != 0) < 3
            for (j <- unrollIf(sparse, 0 until n)) {
              v1(i) = v1(i) + a(i).apply(j) * v(j)
